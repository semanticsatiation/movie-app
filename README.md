## Lessons learned
This was my first big application ever so it was a huge learning experience for me overall.

Learning how to work with Rails, learning how to work with MVC model, learning how to work with the database, etc...

Also figuring out how to deploy my app and making it live was really fun and enlightening.

Lots of difficult things I had to learn on my own but it was worth it as now I can easily create and deploy app with ease!

## Lessons learned
This was my first big application ever so it was a huge learning experience for me overall.

Learning how to work with Rails, learning how to work with the MVC model, learning how to work with a PostgreSQL database, learning how to implement user/admin privileges, etc...

Also figuring out how to deploy my app and making it live!  Which was really fun and enlightening.

Lots of difficult things I had to learn on my own but it was worth it as now I can easily create and deploy any app with ease!
